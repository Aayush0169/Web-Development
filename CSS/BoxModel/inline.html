    After the IoT device collects data from its surroundings data and
     aggregates the information within a data center or cloud, software processes it. The device can decide to perform an action like sending an alert to a user or automatically adjusting a sensor without user intervention.

As data is assembled, many IoT devices can learn about user preferences and automatically adjust to match those preferences. The combination of data processing and machine learning is what makes some IoT products smart devices.




The fact that IoT devices can learn without programming is incredibly valuable. 

Think of the smart thermostat that automatically adjusts itself to the ideal indoor temperature or the smart refrigerator that does not just notify you that you are low on a certain grocery item, but automatically orders a replacement.
