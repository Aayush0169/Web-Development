# Web-Development
Welcome to my repository! This repo contains all the practice codes and projects I have created during my journey of learning web development. You'll find a variety of examples that showcase my understanding and application of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

Contents:

HTML Basics: Simple web pages with structure and semantic elements.

CSS Styling: Stylesheets for enhancing the look and feel of web pages.

Bootstrap Framework: Responsive design and components using Bootstrap.

JavaScript Fundamentals: Scripts for interactive and dynamic content.

This repository will continue to grow as I learn more. Future additions will include new practice codes and projects as I explore more advanced topics and techniques in web development. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute. Let's learn and grow together in the world of web development!
